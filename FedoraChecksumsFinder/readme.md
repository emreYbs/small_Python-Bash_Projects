 **This script will find the Checksums URLs from the mirror sites by _fuzzing_  the pre-given links**. </br>
 _It will also download the URLs to a .csv and .txt file._ </br>
 **The official Fedora website doesn't have the checksums for Python Classroom Lab _for months!_** </br>
 **So**, I had to find the **checksums** for Fedora39 Python Classroom from the mirror sites.
 
 - If you feel like being lazy, then just use the **Fedore Writer** tool to write the ISO to a USB stick. It automatically checks the **checksums**:)
 - **OR** just get them here: https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/alt/releases/39/Labs/x86_64/iso/
