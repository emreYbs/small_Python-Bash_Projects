BTW, in these kinds of promotion emails, there is a notion of _UTM_ which means:
 "Successful marketers use many tools to track and measure the effectiveness of their digital marketing campaigns, including Urchin Tracking Module (UTM) codes, which are snippets of code attached to the end of a URL. UTM codes are also used to pinpoint specific sources of traffic to a website."
