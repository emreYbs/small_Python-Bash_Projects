## Project 1: 
### _Udemy Promotion Link Cleaner_
*This script will clean the Udemy promotion link and remove the tracking parameters from the final URL.*
- Also it will give you the Coupon Code the long promotion URL

- By the way, this script can also clean the tracking in URLS apart from UDEMY promotion emails. 
**I wrote it to use generally for Udemy promotion emails but bear it in mind that it can also work for other links.**
  So you can convert a URL like this _https://click.convertkit-mail.com/4zum35r2g4ueh5lqeezfxh3d3ml77/58hvh8umkz4mw4s7/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3RhdGlvbngubmV0L2dvb2dsZS1kb3JrLW1ha2VyLw==_

BTW, in these kinds of promotion emails, there is a notion of _UTM_ which means:
 "Successful marketers use many tools to track and measure the effectiveness of their digital marketing campaigns, including Urchin Tracking Module (UTM) codes, which are snippets of code attached to the end of a URL. UTM codes are also used to pinpoint specific sources of traffic to a website."

## Project 2:
